/* 
 * This is a modal where users will be able to filter data.
 * 
 * some of the filters will be accessible by the public and some will not.
 * 
 * For example, the public should not get access to owner data. However,
 * we should check if a user is logged in and if so, we can show owner filters.
 * 
 * Note that this is a pop-up modal and should not be called directly from the
 * controler. Instead, this modal should be called from search.php
