	- a single row can not have a tomb_id and columbarium_id at the same time.
	- a buried individual that is not linked to any columbarium or tomb should have both columns (tomb_id and columbarium_id) set to null.
- If a columbarium or tomb is set open, they MUST have an owner ID set.
- A columbarium or tomb can not have an owner_id, or be associated with any buried individual.
